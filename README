# Instructions for using this Vagrantfile:

# 0. If you haven't installed vagrant and virtualbox, do so.
# 1. Put the Vagrantfile in a folder by itself.  (It's okay to have this README in the same folder.)
# 2. cd into that folder.  Then run the following:

vagrant up
# This will take roughly an hour and a half, as it will first download a minimal basebox, then
# install ALL software needed to run softcover, including the several GB worth of tex packages.
# Do it with a good internet connection.  Run it as `time vagrant up` if you're curious how long
# it will take.

vagrant ssh

# You are now logged in to the vagrant box.  Don't do your work yet, though!

# If you want other packages to be installed, do it now.  For example:
sudo apt-get -y install vim
sudo apt-get -y install git

# Do the following (ON THE VAGRANT BOX) to make it as small and clean as possible for repackaging:
sudo apt-get clean
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/EMPTY bs=1M
sudo rm -f /EMPTY
cat /dev/null > ~/.bash_history && history -c && exit

# Do the following to package your box:
vagrant package --output softcover-ubuntu-14.04.box

# Do the following to add the box to your system in vagrant and make it usable:
vagrant box add softcover-ubuntu-14.04 softcover-ubuntu-14.04.box
# After you've done this the softcover-ubuntu-14.04.box file will not be used again.
# You can delete it safely, or save it if you want.

# Make a new folder where you will have the new vagrant box, cd into it and then:
vagrant init softcover-ubuntu-14.04

# You can now vagrant up and vagrant destroy all you want, and
# softcover and asciidoc will be fully usable from the moment you vagrant ssh.
# The directory on your host computer where the Vagrantfile is stored will be accessible
# from the guest as /vagrant and I recommend keeping all softcover project directories in there.
